# MindRove SDK Header Files

This folder should contain the C/C++ header files (`*.h`) from the MindRove SDK.

## Setup Instructions

1. Download the appropriate SDK release for your OS from the [MindRoveSDK GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MindRove/MindRoveSDK/releases).
2. Extract the `inc/` folder from the archive.
3. Copy all `.h` files into this `inc/` directory.

These files are required for compiling and integrating with the MATLAB.
